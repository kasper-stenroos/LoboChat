  "body": "### Overview\r\nSchool project for Application Development Methods course. The target environment is a fictional hospital and the user group consists of doctors, nurses and other personnel.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\nThe users are able to start private and group conversations, see online/offline users list and send instant alerts to other users. They are able to take a look at message and alert history, give topics to the conversations and quickly choose details for the alerts from predefined alternatives.\r\n\r\n### Upcoming Features\r\nDuring the following course, Software Structures and Models, we are going to integrate database support for the application and create an Android client. Other possible features include e.g. multimedia transfer and further development of the already existing features, for example adding an ability to choose exact ward or room of origin for the alerts.\r\n\r\n### Technical Details\r\nThe back-end is implemented with Java using Jersey framework and the front-end is based on a web client implemented with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and Ajax. The notification system is based on Java web sockets. The application has optimized UIs for mobile, tablet and desktop use.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nFour member group (@orostider, @kjghtp, @kasper-stenroos and @aidesign) studying Software Engineering on second year (Bachelor of Engineering).",
